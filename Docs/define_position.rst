Define a position using the pointer on the 3D view
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Many elements of the tree 'Data' require to define a 'Position' (x,y,z) in the 3D geometry. Data can be defined:

- by filling the corresponding cells (x, y and z) in the corresponding 'Properties' window;
- by using the pointer. In this last case, user has to point the 'Position' element with the pointer in the tree:
	* **Right click** on the 'Position' element;
	* **Select** the 'Define in the 3D view' option in the contextual menu;
	* Then, in the 3D view, users point a position on a visible face; this will affect the values (x,y,z) to the 'Position' element. Users can then adjust values in the corresponding cell of the spreadsheet in the 'Properties' window.
