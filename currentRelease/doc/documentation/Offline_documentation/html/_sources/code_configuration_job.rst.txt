Job list
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Instead of running the calculation, manually one after the other, you can create a list of calculation and, thus, run all calculations at once.

.. important::

	To use a job list, you have to create a specific project for each job. If you keep the same project, but if you change only some parameters, you will repeat exactly the same calculation.

- 'Add calculation in the job list'
	Add the calculation of the given project in the job list.

- 'Clear job list'
	Clear the job list.

- 'Run job list'
	Run the job list.

- 'Show job list'
	Show the job list in the tab 'Messages' of the 'Console'.
