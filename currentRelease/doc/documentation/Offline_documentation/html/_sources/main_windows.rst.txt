'Main' window
==============

The '3D View' window contains the 3D model of the scene. Depending on the Pointer mode, several actions are possible:

- face selection (|selectsurface|)

- navigation in the scene (See `Camera mode`_ for details)

- data extraction

.. tip::

	The main window is (un)dockable. You can display the Main window on a second screen (see menu 'Windows > 3D View' options)
