This menu propose several display modes for the 3D view of the geometry.

‘Face’
~~~~~~

‘Oustide’
	Show faces oriented outside the geometry. If all faces are well oriented, only the exterior of the geometry should be visible.

‘Inside’
	Show faces oriented inside the geometry. If all faces are well oriented, only the interior of the geometry should be visible.
	
‘None’
	Hide all faces.

‘Material color’
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

‘Original’
	Show faces with their original color/texture (*i.e.* following the CAD exportation)
	
‘Material’
	Show faces with color associated with materials (*i.e.* following I-Simpa material assignation).

‘Lines’
~~~~~~~

‘All’
	All lines are visible.
	
‘Contour’
	Show lines around co-planar surfaces (co-planar faces are merged, only for the display).
	
‘None’
	Hide all lines.

‘Hide meshing’
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If a mesh has been generated, this option allow to hide the mesh representation in the 3D view

‘Reinitialize camera’
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Return to the default 3D view.

‘Camera’
~~~~~~~~

Change the camera mode (use the mouse and/or the arrow keys to change the view.

‘First person’ mode: Users visualize the 3D scene with its own eyes:
	- Left clic + motion (left, right, up, down) ≡ head motion (left, right, up, down)
	- Right clic + motion (left, right) ≡ head motion (left, right)
	- Right clic + motion (up, down) ≡ zoom + and zoom -

‘Rotation/Zoom’ mode
	-  Left clic + motion (up, down) ≡ zoom + and zoom -
	-  Left clic + motion (left, right) ≡ zoom + and zoom -
	-  Right clic + motion (left, right, up, down) ≡ rotation (left, right, up, down)
	-  Center clic: move scene

‘XY grid’
~~~~~~~~~

Select this options to display the XY grid. The corresponding grid can also be displayed using the ‘XYZ axis’ properties of ‘Display’ element of the tree ‘Scene’).

‘XZ grid’
~~~~~~~~~

Select this options to display the XZ grid. The corresponding grid can also be displayed using the ‘XYZ axis’ properties of ‘Display’ element of the tree ‘Scene’).

‘YZ grid’
~~~~~~~~~

Select this options to display the YZ grid. The corresponding grid can also be displayed using the ‘XYZ axis’ properties of ‘Display’ element of the tree ‘Scene’).

‘Export 3D view’
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Allow to save the 3D view in a file (PNG, JPG, BMP).

‘To file’
	Open a File Dialog box for saving the 3D view in a file with a specific format and a default resolution (800×600).

‘To a file with a specified resolution’
	Open a File Dialog box for saving the 3D view in a file with a specific format and a given resolution.
