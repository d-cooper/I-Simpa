Scene creation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Create a new geometry
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The first step is to create the geometry. As we consider a simple rectangular geometry with the same material of each mean face, the built-in option for creating a rectangular room can be used.

.. note::

	Remember that for more complicate room shapes of for rectangular room with different materials on a same main face, user will have to create the geometry with a CAD software.

1. **Start** I-Simpa
2. When starting I-Simpa, the default project is the last saved project. To clear I-Simpa, **select** 'New project' in the File menu or **click** on the 'New project' icon on the 'File' toolbar to clear I-Simpa
3. In the menu file, **select** 'New scene'.
4. **Enter** the given size of the room (width: 6m, length: 10m and height: 3m), then **click** on 'OK'.
5. The 'Loading 3D scene' windows appears. Leave the default values (you can also deselect all options; this will not change the result) and **click** on 'OK'.

Define surfaces
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The second step is to affect one material for each main faces. Here, we will consider 3 surface groups: the 'Floor', the 'Walls' and the 'Ceiling'.

1. **Select** the mode 'Face selection' on the toolbar 'Selection'
2. **Hold** the CTRL key and **double-click** on the floor in the '3D view':

   -  this will select all co-planar faces (i.e. both triangular faces of the floor);
   -  the 2 corresponding elements will be underlined in the 'Surface' folder of the tree 'Data';

3. **Uses** the right click on one of the 2 selected 'Surface' elements in the surfaces group in the Scene tree: a contextual menu will appear, and **Select** 'Send to a new face group'
4. a new surface group, named 'group', is created.

.. note::
	A new group is created with the default name 'group'. Group surfaces can have the same name, , since each group is identified with its own internal Id.

5. **Right click** on the new corresponding group and **Select** 'Rename' to rename the group with the name 'floor' (you can also use the Left click on the group name to change the name)

.. tip::

	Instead of using the 'Face selection' mode, you can create 2 new groups ('Floor' and 'Ceiling' for example), select the corresponding surfaces within the 'Group' folder and send them to a new face group. You can also directly move the corresponding surfaces to their corresponding surfaces group using the pointer.

6. Once the surface groups are defined, **Left click** on a group and select a material in the Material list element in the Properties windows. Repeat the procedure for each surface group, with the following material (for example): Ceiling: '30% absorbing', Floor: '10% absorbing', Walls: '20% absorbing'

Define a sound source
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

1. **Right click** on the 'Sound sources' root folder in the Data tree of the Scene tab and **Select** 'New source'. A new source is created.

2. **Select** the 'Position' element and gives the values of the source coordinates (3, 5, 1.8).

3. **Select** the 'Sound power' element and **Choose** the 'White noise' spectrum in the Spectrum list (it should be the default spectrum).

4. In the 'Global' element of the 'Sound power' properties, **Defines** the value '80' for the 'Global' value of the 'Lw' tab element. This will define a global sound power of 80 dB.

Define a surface receiver
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

1. **Right click** on the 'Surface receiver' root folder in the Data tree of the Scene tab and **Select** 'New scene receiver'. A new surface receiver is created.

2. In the 'Surfaces' root folder, **Select** the 'Floor' group (**Left click** and **Hold**) and move it in the 'Surfaces' element of the surface receiver. It will define a surface receiver on the room floor.

Define two punctual receivers
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

1. **Right click** on the 'Punctual receiver' root folder in the Data tree of the Scene tab and **Select** 'New receiver'. A new punctual receiver is created.

2. **Select** the 'Position' element and define the coordinates (x,y,z) of the punctual receiver. You can choose (1.,1.,1.8) for example.

3. **Repeat** the two fiorst step for the second receiver at location (3.,7.,1.8) for example.

Calculation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

TCR code
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

1. **Select** the 'Meshing' element in the 'Classical theory of reverberation' code.

2. **Enable** the 'Surface receivers constraint'.

3. In the 'Surface receivers constraint (mÂ²)' element, **Define** the value '0.1'. This allows to resample the corresponding surfaces for the surface receiver. In the other hand (without defining a surface receiver constraint), only the two initial surface element of the floor will be used as receiver, leading to a very poor definition.

4. **Right click** on the 'Classical theory of reverberation' and **Select** 'Run calculation' to start the simulation.

SPPS code
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

1-3. **Repeat** the same 1-3 steps as for the TCR code.

4. **Right click** on the 'SPPS' and **Select** 'Run calculation' to start the simulation.

Results
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. note::

	The 'Results' tab correspond exactly on the image of the data on the hard disk. You can open the file explorer by a **Right click** on a result folder and by selecting 'Open folder'. You can delete a folder or a file, either using the file explorer or the 'Delete' action (**Right click** on the folder/element in the results folder) within I-Simpa.

.. note::

	For each new simulation, a specific folder in created in the corresponding simulation folder (*i.e.* SPPS or TCR), with a name that is defined from the starting time and date of the simulation.

.. tip::

	Most of results are displayed in table. You can select cells in the table, right click on the selection and select 'New diagram' to create a graphical display of the results. You can also export data to a csv file by selecting 'Save data as...'.

TCR code
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

1. **Unfold** the 'Results' folder in the 'Classical theory of reverberation' folder.

2. **Unfold** the 'Punctual receiver' folder, and **Double left click** on one element (*i.e.* one of the two receivers that have been created). A new window is displayed, showing the SPL at the receiver for the direct field and the total field (diffuse field + direct field) according to the Sabine and Eyring formulae.

3. **Unfold** the 'Total field' folder (Sabine or Eyring), **Select** the surface receiver, **Select** the frequency band and **Right click** on the 'Sound level' element and **Choose** 'Load animation', then 'Cumulating sound level'. It displays the sound map for the corresponding surface receiver on the 3D view. You can remove the colormap on the 3D view by clicking on the 'Dash' icon on the 'Simulation' toolbar.

4. **Double left click** on the 'Main results'. It opens a new display with some general results for the whole room (global reverberation time, SPL of the diffuse sound field and equivalent absorption according to the Sabine and Eyring formulae)

SPPS code
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
1. **Unfold** the 'Results' folder in the 'SPPS' folder.

2. **Unfold** the 'Punctual receiver' folder, **Unfold** the folder for a given punctual receiver and **Left click** on one element to display the corresponding results (for example: 'Sound level'). A new window is displayed, showing the results.

3. **Right click** on the 'Sound level' element and **Select** 'Calculate acoustics parameters'. It opens a new window: **Keep** the default values, and **Select** 'OK'. It creates two new elements 'Schroeder curves' and 'Acoustic parameters'. **Select** the new elements to display the corresponding results in a spreadsheet.

4. **Right click** on the 'Advanced sound level' element and **Select** 'Calculate acoustics parameters'. It opens a new window: **Keep** the default values, and **Select** 'OK'. It creates a new element 'Advanced acoustic parameters'. **Select** the element to display the corresponding results in a spreadsheet.

5. **Unfold** the surface receiver folder, **Select** the frequency band and **Right click** on the 'Sound level' element and **Choose** 'Load animation', then **Choose** an option (for example: 'Instantaneaous sound level'). It displays the (animated) sound map for the corresponding surface receiver on the 3D view. You can remove the colormap on the 3D view by clicking on the 'Dash' icon, or if required, pause/resume/stop... the animation using the 'Simulation' toolbar.

	- 'Instantaneaous sound level'
		Shows the time varying sound level (animation)

	- 'Cumulative instantaneaous sound level'
		Shows the time varying sound level by cumulating all previous time step (animation)

	- 'Cumulating sound level'
		Shows the cumulating sound level (no animation)

.. note::

	You may change the `properties of the 'Sound level' element`_, for example the 'Maximum value (dB)' and the 'Minimum value (dB)' for displaying the colormap in a good way.

5. **Unfold** the surface receiver folder, **Select** the frequency band and **Right click** on the 'Sound level' element and **Choose** 'Acoustic parameters', then **Choose** a given parameters from the list. It creates one or more new elements (acoustic parameters). **Right click** on a given acoustic parameter and **Select** 'Load animation' to display the corresponding parameter on the 3D view.
