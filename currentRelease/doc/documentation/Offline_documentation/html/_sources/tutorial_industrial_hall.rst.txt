Study of an industrial room
----------------------------

In this example, we are interested in the case of an industrial hall coupled with other rooms. This hall is composed of two identical noisy machines and two fitting zones (zones made of many objects that act as acoustics scaterrers). The purpose of this tutorial is to:

- illustrate the creation of machines
- illustrate the creation of fitting zones
- create new surface Materials
- create a line of receivers
- create a plane receiver
- perform calculations using the SPPS code
- study the effect of changing a material on a wall of the industrial hall, on the sound field

Resources for this tutorial are located in the following folder:
::

	<I-Simpa installation folder>\doc\tutorial\tutorial 3

This folder contains several files:

- ``tutorial_3.proj``:  I-Simpa project of the present tutorial (without Results)
- ``Industrial_hall.ply``: 3D hall geometry
- additional PNG images (screenshots)

.. important::

	If not already done, we suggest you to follow the two previous tutorials, before the present tutorial:

	- `Study of a teaching room`_
	- `Study of the Elmia hall`_

.. _`Study of a teaching room`: tutorial_teaching_room.html
.. _`Study of the Elmia hall`: tutorial_elmya_hall.html

Import a geometry
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The first step is to import the geometry of the project. We are interested here in a large industrial hall coupled to a corridor through a door in a wall, this corridor being itself coupled to another room. We assume that walls and doors allow acoustic transmission.

1. In the 'File' menu, **Select** 'Import new scene', and open the file ``LocalIndustriel.ply`` located in the correspondng tutorial folder.

2. In the next windows, **Select** 'OK' without changing the default values.

.. note::

	When importing the model, several surfaces groups are created. These groups were defined at the 3D scene creation with the CAD software.

Define a machine as a sound source
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

At this step, we want to create the sound sources. In industrial environments, sound sources are often machines or workstations made up of several source points. Since the hall can be made up of several identical machines located at different locations, it is simpler to define a machine in the form of a group of sound sources, which group can then be copied and moved within the room. In our example, we will define machines composed of three sound sources, which will be duplicated. Each sound source will be defined by a pink noise spectrum, with a global level of 80 dB.

1. **Right-click** the 'Data/Sound Sources' element in the 'Scene' tab of the 'Project' windows, and **Select** 'New Group'. By default, the name of the new group is 'Sound sources'.
2. **Rename** the group as the following 'Milling machine';
3. **Right-click** on the 'Milling Machine' group and select 'New Source'. **Perform** this operation three times (to create three sources), named 'Source 1', 'Source 2' and 'Source 3'. It is possible to modify the name of the sources by applying the same method as for the name of a group;
4. For each source, **Unfold** the source properties, then **Click** on the 'Position' item, and **Assign** the following coordinates (x,y,z) for the source 1 (2,7,1.2), the source 2 (2,6,0.6) and the source 3 (1,7,0.75).
5. For each source, **Select** the 'Sound power' element, **Choose** 'Pink Noise', and then **Set** the global level 'Lw' to 80dB.

Duplicate the machine
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The previous machine can then be duplicated and moved into the room.

1. **Right-click** on the 'Milling Machine' group and **Select** 'Copy';
2. **Right-click** the 'Sound Sources' root folder, then **Select** 'Paste': an item named 'Copy of Sound sources' is created.

.. note::

	The sound sources within the new group have exactly the same properties as the original sources, including the names of the sources. However there is no possible confusion between two sources with the same name, each source having its own internal identifier.

3. **Rename** the group created in 'Milling machine 2';
4. Since the new machine is located in the same place as the original machine, it is necessary to move it. To perform a translation of the new machine, **Right-click** on the 'Milling Machine 2' group and **Select** :menuselection:`All sources --> Translation item` menu;
5. **Set** the translation values in each direction (x,y,z) to [5,-2,0], and **Click** on 'OK'. The sources group is translated.

Define a scene volume as a fitting zone
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are two methods of creating a fitting zone in the room:

- when creating the scene with the CAD software. In this case, a closed volume is modeled in the 3D geometric model. It is then a 'Scene fitted zone'
- either in I-Simpa, in the form of a parallelepipedal zone. It is then a 'Rectangular fitted zone'

In our example, a parallelepipedal zone has already been provided at the creation of the 3D scene, in order to be assigned to a 'Scene fitted zone'.

1. In the 'Scene' tree, **Right-click** on the 'Fitting zone' root folder and **Select** 'Define scene fitted zone';

2. Now you have to define the surfaces of the scene for the corresponding zone. **Select** the surface selection mode on the 'Selection' toolbar; **Hold** Ctrl keyboard key and **Double-click** on each face element of the the fitting zone. Each face element is selected in red (or another color depending of the I-Simpa Settings). At the same time, the corresponding face elements are also highlighted in the folder 'Surfaces' of the 'Data' tree.

.. note::

	Holding the Ctrl keyboard key allow to select all coplanar face element by a double click. You can also use the same procedure, but with one single click, to select each face element independently.

3. In the folder 'Surfaces' of the 'Data' tree, **Select** all highlighted face elements, and **drag/drop** them to the 'Surfaces' element of the fiiting zone. All face elements are then duplicated in this folder.

.. note::

	In this example, all face elements were already identified in a given folder 'fitting' of the 'Data' tree, because this volume was build when preparing the 3D geometry. In this case, it was not necessary to follow the step 2 of this procedure. One can directly drag and drop all face elements of the corresponding surface folder.

4. One must also select the face elements of the fitting zone that are located on the ground. **Open** the 'floor' surface group and find the two face elements that correspond to the floor of the fitting zone (**Select** each face element of the group and **Identify** the ones that correspond to the fitting zone). Once the two face elements are identified, **Select** them and drag/drop them to the 'Surfaces' element of the fitting zone.

5. **Define** the 'Acoustic parameters' of the fitted zone, with 0.25 for 'Alpha' (absorption coefficient of the obstacles), 0.5 m for 'Lambda' (mean free path in the fitted zone) and 'Uniform reflection'. See the SPPS documentation for more information about acoustic parameters of fitted zones.

.. tip::

		When you define value in a spreadsheet (for example 'Alpha' in the example above), you can duplicate the value in all the column (i.e. frequency bands) by selecting ::menuselection:`Set the same value --> To the column` after a Right-Click on the corresponding value.

		You can also define an average value by setting a value to 'Average' (last row of the spreadsheet), which will define the same value for all the rows (i.e. frequency bands).

   Fitting zones representation (scene and parallelipipedic fitting zones)

Define a parallelipipedic volume as a fitting zone
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

One may create a fitting zone as a parallelipipedic volume directly within I-Simpa. Such volume is defined by creating the two opposite corners of the volume. In the following example, one consider a fitting zone made of chairs.

1. **Right-Click** on the 'Fitted zone' element of the 'Data' tree, and **Select** 'Define rectangular fitted zone'. A new fitted zone is created.

2. **Define** the 'Position' element (coordinates) of the opposite corners of the fitting zone, 'Origin volume' and 'Destination volume', as (13,4,0) and (18,1,1.2) respectively.

3. **Define** the 'Acoustic parameters' of the fitted zone, with 0.15 for 'Alpha' (absorption coefficient of the obstacles), 0.3 m for 'Lambda' (mean free path in the fitted zone) and 'Uniform reflection'.

Define surface materials
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

User can define specific material for the project.

1. **Unfold** the 'Materials' element of the 'Project database' element of the 'Project' tree and **Right-Click** on the 'User' element. **Select** 'New material'. A 'New material' is created. **Rename** the name of the corresponding material to 'Trans_material'.

2. **Select** the 'Material spectrum' element to display the acoustic parameters of the corresponding material. **Set** the values of each parameters according to the following table.

3. **Go to** the 'Surfaces' folder in the 'Data' tree. **Select** the 'trans_ro1' surface to display the coresponding 'Properties' and **set** the 'Material' parameter to the 'Trans_material' material. **Repeat** this procedure for the 'trans_room' surface group.

4. **Create** a new material 'Open_door' using the same procedure as for 'Trans_material', using the following parameters, and **Set** this material to the 'door_room1' and 'door_room2' surface groups.

5. For all other surfaces groups, **Set** the material to '30% absorbing' from the 'Reference materials' database.

.. tip::

	For all these surface groups, since the surface material is the same, user can move all surface elements to a given surface group and set the material to this surface group only.

.. note::

	The surface elements that have been defined as fitting surfaces (i.e. 'fitting' surface group) are consider as perfeclty transparent by default. CAUTION

.. tip::

	In order to verify that material have been correctly set, you can display the 3D by selecting the 'Material' option in the ::menuselection:`View --> Material color` menu.

   Representation of material of scene surfaces

Insert a line of punctual receivers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Instead of creating punctual receivers individually, you can directly create a line (or an grid) of punctual sound sources.

1. **Go to** the 'Punctual receivers' folder in the 'Data' tree and **Right-Click** on it. Thus, **Select** the 'Create a receveir grid' option.

2. A spreadsheed is displayed to define the receiver grid parameters. See `the corresponding documentation for more information concerning these parameters`_. **Set** the following values:

.. _`the corresponding documentation for more information concerning these parameters`: manipulate_sources_receivers.html

.. tip::

	To create a grid of receivers instead of a line of receivers in the example above, change the value of the 'Number of cols' parameter to 2 or more.

Define a plane receiver
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Following the same procedure than for the `Elmia tuturial`_, **Create** a 'New plane receiver', using the default parameters.

3. **Right click** the 'Frequency bands' element and **Select** the option 'Automatic selection', 'Octave', 'Building/Road [125-4000] Hz'.

4. **Run** the calculation code by right-clicking on the 'SPPS' element and selecting 'Run calculation'


Evaluate the effect of changing one surface material
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

One can be interesting to evaluate the effect of changing one surface material. I-Simpa includes a tool that allows to compare two results on a surface material. For such operation it is important that the surface receiver is not changed between the tow simulation.

1. **Create** a new material named 'Aborbing_material' using the following data:

.. list-table:: Acoustical properties of the 'Absorbing_material' material

     - Specular

2. **Set** the 'Diff_wall' surface to the new material 'Absorbing_material'.

3. **Run** a new SPPS calculation using the same calculation parameters. At this step, two simulation results are available in the 'Results' tab of the SPPS code.

4. **Goto** to :menuselection:`Tools --> 'File results process' --> 'Compare surface receivers'` menu

5. In the list, **Select** the data 'rs_cut' in the :menuselection:`'Surface receiver' --> 'Global'` list element of the surface receivers used as a 'reference' (should be the first calculation, but you can choose the second calculation instead), then **Select** 'Next'.

6. In the list, **Select** the data 'rs_cut' in the :menuselection:`'Surface receiver' --> 'Global'` list element of the surface receiver that must be compared to the reference (i.e. the 'other simulation', should be the second calculation, but you can choose the first calculation instead). At this step, you can defined a name for the difference between the two results ('reference' - 'other simulation') (by default 'Power gain') and create a new data file by checking the corresponding box. Then **Select** 'Finish'. The corresponding result is created in the folder :menuselection:`'Surface receiver' --> 'Global'` of the second result.

7. **Right-click** on the 'Power gain' result and **choose** :menuselection:`'Load animation' --> 'Cumulating sound level'` to display a sound map of the difference between the two results.
